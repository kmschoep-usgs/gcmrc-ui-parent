					 INTERPOLATION SETTINGS **
					In general, it is assumed that real data exists between individual measurements and the value of
					that real data can be determined by interpolation.  However, it wouldn't make sense to interpolate
					b/t two values *very* far apart in time - that limit is set by MAX_INTERPOLATION_DAYS.

					Sometime there is a known time period of invalid data.  This is recorded as a time period bounded
					by the DATA_GAP_MARKER in the FINAL_VALUE column.  The DB ensures that no values occur in the timeseries
					b/t DATA_GAP_MARKER's.  The DATA_GAP_MARKER is always -999.

					Interpolation can still be done through invalid time periods if the invalid time period is less than
					MAX_GAP_MINUTES.

					ASSUMPTION:  THE DB CONTAINS NO DATA WITH -999 VALUES THAT ARE NOT CONSECUTIVE.

					   beyond each limit).  Invalid gaps (marked with DATA_GAP_MARKERs) will be reomved and interpolation
					   over gaps will be done.

					   A MTI is a period of known time and measured values that occurs between two individual measurements.
					   Thus, it has a starting value, an ending value, a starting time and an ending time.  As an example,
					   in the diagram below, the vertical lines represent rows in the db and the space between are the
					   rows created in this query:

							|   MTI1   |   MTI2   |   MTI3 (has no end time or end value)   
						   DB1        DB2        DB3

					   The db countains measured time-ordered results DB1, DB2 and DB3, each with a time and value.
					   This result of the example above would be:
						MTI1: Start_Time and Start_Value from the time and value of DB1, End_Time
						 and End_Value from the time and value of DB2.
						MTI2:  Similar to Result1, just shifted.
						MTI3:  Will have a null End_Time and End_Value

				   <!-- POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
					 Rather than join all possible data-bin combinations and then use CASE to
					 select the correct calculation, it might be faster to individually join the
					 different types of data-bin combos and UNION the results togetheer.  The advantage
					 would be that the CASE statements would not be needed because the data-bin
					 relation would be known.  The down side would that that multiple passes through
					 the dataset would be required, so its not clear that it would be faster.

							All these CASE statements deal w/ handling 4 possible cases for a Measured
							Data Chunk (MTI).  A MTI block of known time and values and it occurs between
							two individual measurements.  Thus, it has a starting value, an ending value
							and a duration.  It doesn't matter for the calculation if the values are
							increasing from initial measure to ending measure, so instead of working with
							the start and end value, most of the comparisons are done using min and max
							values of an MTI.

							The bins define a high and low bound, and there are four cases of how an
							MTI could line up with an individual bin:
							|      |      |      |
							|    *=|======|===*  | Case 1:  The MTI spans beyond both the upper and lower bin bounds
							|   *==|==*   |      | Case 2:  The MTI spans beyond the lower bound (but not the upper)
							|      |   *==|=*    | Case 3:  The MTI spans beyond the upper bound (but not the lower)
							|      | *==* |      | Case 4:  The MTI is completely within the upper and lower bounds of the bin
							|      |      |      |
							======================
							|  B1L |======| B1U  | The bounds of a single bin (B1) with its upper and lower bounds
